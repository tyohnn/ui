 * A trend as a row of small bars, one per period, each at a level from 0 (a faint dot: nothing happened) to 4.
 * Decorative: say the trend in words next to it when it matters. The bar sizes are the graphic's own geometry.
 * `loading` draws `count` bars at the lowest height in the border colour, so the row is there and says nothing;
 * like Person it sits in a cell, so it marks no frame of its own.
